# New York City Airbnb Rental Price Prediction

In this project, I explore how location can help predict Airbnb rental price in NYC.

The dataset is acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data)

NYC is one of the most expensive cities in the world. However, it also has one the 
strongest tourism. As a result, Airbnb has a thriving marketplace in NYC.

I am interested in predicting the rental price of a listing based on the listing's location.
In this project, I conducted standard data science pipeline. I compared models such as 
K-Nearest Neighbors and Linear Regression to find the most effective predictive model.
